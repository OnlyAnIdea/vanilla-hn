# The Docs

Welcome to the docs for your vanilla news app! Why do these exist? Isn't this a lot of extra detail for such a simple app? It is most definitely a ton of detail, but a tiny app is actually a great place to have a lot of documentation. There isn't much code to get overwhelmed or distracted by which makes learning a lot easier.
